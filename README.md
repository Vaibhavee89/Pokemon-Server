# PokeMCP

PokeMCP is an MCP (Modular Command Platform) server that provides detailed Pokémon information by integrating with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It exposes a tool to fetch comprehensive data about any Pokémon, including base stats, types, abilities (with effects), moves (with effects), and evolution chain.

## Features
- Fetches Pokémon base stats, types, and abilities (with effect descriptions)
- Retrieves up to 10 moves per Pokémon, including move effects
- Provides the full evolution chain for a given Pokémon
- Handles errors gracefully and returns informative error messages

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.4+
- [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) (for async HTTP requests)
- [mcp.server.fastmcp](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp) (for MCP server framework)

## Installation
1. Install dependencies using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

## Usage

### Development Server
Run the server using uv (ensure you have the required MCP infrastructure):
```bash
uv run mcp dev server.py
```

### Connecting with Claude
Run the following command to connect with Claude:
```bash
uv run mcp install server.py
```

Result should look like this:
```bash
Added server 'poke-mcp' to Claude config   
Successfully installed poke-mcp in Claude app 
```

Now you can use the `poke-mcp` MCP tools in Claude:
